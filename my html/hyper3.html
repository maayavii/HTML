    <h1><u>CHARMINAR</u></h1>
    
    <h2>Charminar is taken from two words Char and Minar which translate as Four Towers in English. Some people say that Charminar was the first structure to be constructed in the newly built city of Hyderabad. It is said that Quli Qutab Shah prayed for the end of the plague and vowed to build a mosque if it was eradicated.</h2>
